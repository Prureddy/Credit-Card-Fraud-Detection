## Introduction
- Credit Card Fraud Detection is a machine learning project that aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques. This project serves as an essential tool for financial institutions and businesses to protect their customers from potential fraudulent activities.

- The goal of this project is to build a robust and accurate fraud detection model that can identify fraudulent transactions effectively while minimizing false positives. The implementation is based on a real-world credit card transaction dataset, and the model is trained using supervised learning techniques.

## Features
- Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
- Easy to use and deploy, making it suitable for integration into existing systems.
- Provides detailed performance metrics and visualization for evaluation.
- Regularly updated and maintained to ensure optimal results with the latest data.
## Installation
- To run the Credit Card Fraud Detection project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
-git clone https://github.com/Prureddy/credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
-Change into the project directory.
-cd credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
-Install the required dependencies.

-pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
- Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can use the project to detect credit card fraud by following these steps:

- Prepare your credit card transaction data in the CSV format.

- Replace the sample dataset with your data in the appropriate directory.

## Run the main script for fraud detection.

-creditFraud.ipynb
-The script will output the results and provide visualizations for easy interpretation.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is a real-world credit card transaction dataset containing a mix of legitimate and fraudulent transactions. It includes various features related to each transaction, such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized credit card information. For confidentiality, the dataset does not contain any personal information.

- Please note that the dataset is provided strictly for educational and research purposes and is not intended for any other use.

# Model
-The fraud detection model in this project is built using a supervised learning approach. It employs a combination of machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks, to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

-The model is trained on historical credit card transaction data with known labels and uses various features from each transaction to make predictions on new, unseen data.

# Performance
- The performance of the fraud detection model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model's performance is also visualized using ROC curves and confusion matrices.

- The goal is to achieve high accuracy while maintaining a balance between precision (minimizing false positives) and recall (minimizing false negatives) to provide the best possible fraud detection results.

## Contributing
